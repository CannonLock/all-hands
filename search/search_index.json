There is\n\na local shorthand\n for describing locations\nrelative to the city center (Temple Square), which is very logical but may take a bit of getting used to.  The\nUniversity is east of the center, nestled up against the mountains, and the airport is to the west.  All the usual\nmapping tools will help get you around town.\n\n\nHere are some transportation resources for the University and Salt Lake City:\n\n\n\n\nTransportation help from the University Guest House\n\n\nTransportation help from the University International office\n\n\nSalt Lake City International Airport\n\n\nUtah Transit Authority (UTA)\n\u00a0\u2013 bus and TRAX light rail in Salt Lake City area\n\n\nUniversity of Utah shuttle bus\n and \nLive Shuttle Tracking\n\n\nUber\n and \nLyft\n are both active at the airport and around the city\n\n\n\n\n(The University of Utah and Open Science Grid do not endorse or recommend any particular third-party transportation\nservices.  The links above refer to only some of the available transportation options.)\n\n\nParking\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe conference hotel has its own parking lot and is a very short walk to the Officers Club, so there is no need for\nseparate hotel and conference parking if you stay there.\n\n\nFor attendees who drive to the meeting from elsewhere, we will be assigned a parking lot and you can park there for free\nduring the days of the meeting.

There is a local shorthand  for describing locations\nrelative to the city center (Temple Square), which is very logical but may take a bit of getting used to.  The\nUniversity is east of the center, nestled up against the mountains, and the airport is to the west.  All the usual\nmapping tools will help get you around town.  Here are some transportation resources for the University and Salt Lake City:   Transportation help from the University Guest House  Transportation help from the University International office  Salt Lake City International Airport  Utah Transit Authority (UTA) \u00a0\u2013 bus and TRAX light rail in Salt Lake City area  University of Utah shuttle bus  and  Live Shuttle Tracking  Uber  and  Lyft  are both active at the airport and around the city   (The University of Utah and Open Science Grid do not endorse or recommend any particular third-party transportation\nservices.
