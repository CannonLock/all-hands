We are planning a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF6600;">hybrid event</span>:
The **online parts** will have presentations and discussions as in the past 2 years,
and the **in-person parts** (scheduled around the online program) will focus on interaction.

Details on registration (in-person and online), costs (in-person only), facilities,
and so forth will be posted soon (January).

## Online Program

*   **Friday**: U.S. ATLAS and CMS Projects

## In-Person Program

Note that the in-person program will be Monday through Wednesday only.
There will be structued (but optional) events, plus unstructured time to mingle with colleagues.
Current plans, which may change, include:

*   Speak with Researchers
*   Hybrid User Office Hours
*   Site Admin Office Hours
*   Technology Chalkboard Time (Q&A with drawings!)

## Logistics

In-person participation will include a standard registration fee;
online-only participation will continue to be free.
Registration for both parts will open in January 2022.

Note that the deadline for registration for the in-person parts is February 17.
If at least 30 people register for the in-person parts by that date,
and if enough staff are available,
we plan to proceed with the hybrid event;
otherwise, we will have to cancel the in-person parts and have just the online parts.
