# OSG All-Hands Meetings

The [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org) (OSG) has an annual All-Hands Meeting for users, resource
providers, staff, and other people who are interested in what we do and how we do it.  The meeting is usually hosted by
an OSG resource provider and so the location varies each year.

Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).  The [agenda](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/15344/) will be detailed soon.
