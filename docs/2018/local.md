## Parking

The conference hotel has its own parking lot and is a very short walk to the Officers Club, so there is no need for
separate hotel and conference parking if you stay there.

For attendees who drive to the meeting from elsewhere, we will be assigned a parking lot and you can park there for free
during the days of the meeting.  Details on which parking lot to use will be posted closer to the event.
