# OSG All-Hands Meeting 2020 &ndash; Reschedule FAQs

On 4 March 2020, the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org) (OSG)
All-Hands Meeting 2020 was officially postponed.  The new dates for the meeting
will be announced on March 13.

Below are some possible questions and our best answers at this time.

## General Questions

*   Why was the All-Hands Meeting postponed?

    Due to the coronavirus situation in the U.S. and around the world, and out
    of an abundance of caution, we decided to postpone the meeting.  Further,
    some of our colleagues started learning of suggested or actual travel
    restrictions from their home institutions.  Considering all the available
    evidence, including how rapidly the situation seemed to be changing, it
    seemed best to postpone.

*   Will the All-Hands Meeting still happen in 2020?

    We certainly hope so!  At this time, we are evaluating options for new dates
    in late summer or early fall.  The plan is to announce a new schedule on
    March 13.

*   Where will the rescheduled meeting take place?

    The original plan was to meet at the University of Oklahoma and we have no
    plans to change the venue.  Our hosts there have been incredibly helpful
    throughout the original planning process and especially during the rapid
    change of events in early March, and we look forward to having the meeting
    there.

## Questions for Registrants

*   I paid the registration fee already, so what happens next?

    The University of Oklahoma will automatically refund your original payment
    method for the full registration amount paid.  Refunds will take 2&ndash;4
    weeks to process and then you will get an email.  However, it remains your
    responsibility to verify that your funds were restored.

*   I paid to stay in the on-campus apartments, so what happens next?

    The University of Oklahoma will automatically cancel your reservation and
    process a refund.  See the extra comments above for the registration
    refunds.

*   I reserved a hotel for the event, what should I do?

    You must cancel your own hotel reservations.  Do this before the cutoff
    day/time (often 48 hours prior to check-in, but it may vary) to avoid the
    no-show fee.  And note that the hotels have asked that we all cancel our
    reservations ASAP so they can resell the rooms. For your convenience:

    *   La Quinta: Contact the hotel by calling 405-579-4000 and choosing option
        #5 or email Lq0967gm@laquinta.com.

    *   Fairfield Inn: Contact the hotel by calling 405-447-1661.

*   I reserved a rental car for the event, what should I do?

    Like hotels, you must cancel your own car rental reservation; do so ASAP to
    avoid no-show fees and free up resources.

*   I bought airline tickets for the event, what should I do?

    Work with your travel provider and your local institution to come up with
    the best options here.  It may be helpful to state that the event organizers
    changed dates due to coronavirus concerns.  Hopefully, you can retain some
    value from your existing ticket to apply to future travel.
