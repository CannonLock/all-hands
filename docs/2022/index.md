We are planning a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF6600;">hybrid event</span>:
The **online parts** will have presentations and discussions as in the past 2 years,
and the **in-person parts** (scheduled around the online program) will focus on interaction.

**Registration is now open!**
Please visit [the registration page](registration.md) for details and links.
Be sure to register for **only one** part of the event and
note that registration for in-person attendance includes the online parts.

The complete online program will be posted on [the Indico website](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/53029/timetable/)
as it becomes available.

## In-Person Program

The in-person program will be **Monday through Wednesday** only.
There will be structued (but optional) events, plus unstructured time to mingle with colleagues.
[Current plans](schedule-in-person.md), which may change, include:

*   Speak with Researchers
*   User Office Hours (hybrid)
*   Site Admin Office Hours

**Note that the deadline for registration for the in-person parts is February 17.**
If at least 30 people register for the in-person parts by that date,
and if enough staff are available,
we plan to proceed with the hybrid event;
otherwise, we will have to cancel the in-person parts and have just the online parts.
