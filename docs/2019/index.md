**The meeting will be held jointly with the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) and HEP Software Foundation (HSF)
Workshop,** providing extra opportunities to interact with members of the high-energy physics (HEP) computing community.

Details about the meeting are expected to be available in early 2019.

**Note:** Due to the joint meeting, the macro-schedule of OSG AHM days and topics may be different this year.  For
instance, the usual Monday schedule of US-ATLAS, US-CMS, and FIFE sessions may be held on a different day of the week.
We will post information about the macro-schedule as soon as possible.
