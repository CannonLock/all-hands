# OSG All-Hands Meeting 2020 &ndash; Logistics

## Zoom

We will use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for the OSG All-Hands Meeting this year.
If you have not used Zoom before&hellip; where have you been the past 6 months?
ðŸ˜„
Anyway, be sure to download the client from the [Zoom website](https://zoom.us/download),
because there are impostors out there.

For security reasons,
we will email links to the Zoom meetings directly to the email addresses
provided during [registration](/2020/registration).
Please do not post the links publicly!
If someone you know needs the link, encourage them to register first;
we will resend the links every morning during the meeting.

During presentations, Zoom will be configured to prevent participants from unmuting themselves
and from sharing their screens.
During question time after each presentation,
the session moderator or other staff can unmute you so that you can ask a question.
Be sure to click the raise-hand icon if you want to comment or ask a question after a talk.

Also, the chat feature is enabled and you are welcome to put comments and questions there.
We will have someone watching for questions in the Everyone chat.

## Code of Conduct

We want all participants to be able to enjoy the meeting equally,
so we expect everyone to follow the
[APS Code of Conduct](https://www.aps.org/meetings/policies/code-conduct.cfm).

## Information for Presenters

First, read the information above!
It applies to everyone.
Also, please [register](/2020/registration) for the meeting,
even if you are attending just for your session.

Of course, you are invited to attend the whole session (and more!),
but at very least
please try to arrive and be ready 10&ndash;15 minutes prior to your scheduled start time.

In Zoom, we will make you a Co-Host,
which means that you will have the ability to unmute yourself and share your screen.
Your session moderator will let you know when it is time to do so.

There are MANY websites, videos, and so forth on how to give presentations online,
so we will not repeat those here.
Do remember to turn off device notifications and sounds that might occur during your talk,
and when it is your turn, try to share just the window that shows your presentation.

If you have not presented via Zoom before, it might be best to test your setup in advance.
Please see your confirmation email for times on Friday, August 28, plus a separate Zoom link,
for testing your Zoom setup.
