## Topics

**TBD**

## Format

We are planning a hybrid event:

*  If you register for and travel to the University of Oklahoma for the in-person components,
   you can mingle with colleagues,
   have planned or ad hoc meetings,
   attend workshops or training events,
   and join hack-a-thons.

*  Everyone can enjoy the same kind of presentations and discussions as in the past 2 years,
   whether in-person or online.

## Contacts
