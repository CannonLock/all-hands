# OSG All-Hands Meetings

The Open Science Grid (OSG) has an annual All-Hands Meeting for users, resource providers, staff, and other people who
are interested in what we do and how we do it.  The meeting is usually hosted by an OSG resource provider and varies
each year.

Prior to 2018, All-Hands Meeting websites were hosted at the hosting institution, and over time some of those websites
have been lost.  The links below are as complete as possible at this time.
