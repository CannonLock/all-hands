# OSG All-Hands Meeting 2020 &ndash; Schedule

The [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org) (OSG) All-Hands Meeting
2020 will be held Monday, August 31 through Thursday,
September 3 (rescheduled from March).

## Special Focus Areas

* Supporting researchers and their campuses
* Science with GPUs and in the commercial cloud
* Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)

## High-Level Schedule

Generally, the meetings will occupy just 4 to 5 hours per day, with breaks,
so there will be time to attend and to do other things. We are aiming to
have similar (but updated!) content as planned for March.

Detailed schedule coming in July 2020.
