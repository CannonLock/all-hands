# OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 &ndash; Registration

## Registration for In-Person Attendance

### Costs for in-person attendance

Registration for the in-person OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 costs **$70**, which includes:

* Attendance Monday through Wednesday (Thursday and Friday are virtual only)
* Hot beverage service all day, and morning and afternoon snacks

If OSG cancels the in-person component, you will receive a full refund of your registration fee.

### Registering for in-person attendance

There are separate registration forms for the in-person and virtual-only components.
Please register only once for either the in-person or the virtual.
If you register for in-person you do **not** need to register for the virtual sessions.

Links to the registration forms will be available soon.
Check back here!

**Note:** The registration deadline for in-person attendance is **February 17**.
If at least 30 people register for the in-person parts by that date,
and if enough staff are available,
we plan to proceed with the hybrid event;
otherwise, we will cancel the in-person parts and have just the online parts.
