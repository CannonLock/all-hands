# OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 &ndash; COVID Information

Currently, OSG is planning an in-person component to the OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022.
Of course, we understand that people have questions about COVID policies and procedures for in-person attendance.

If you have questions that are not addressed below, please email us at events@opensciencegrid.org.

**Q: Where can I get information about COVID at University of Oklahoma (OU)?**

**A:** The [OU Together website](https://www.ou.edu/together) is the central OU resource for
COVID resources and policies.

OSG All-Hands Meeting attendees are expected to comply with all OU policies.

**Q: What is the mask policy for the OSG All-Hands Meeting itself?**

**A:** See the [OU Together website](https://www.ou.edu/together) for OU’s policy on masking.
Additionally, OSG will require that all OSG All-Hands Meeting attendees wear masks while indoors at the meeting venue,
unless briefly while eating.

Please consult
[the CDC guide on masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)
for up-to-date recommendations on wearing masks and wear the best mask that you are comfortable with.

**Q: What is the vaccination policy for the OSG All-Hands Meeting itself?**

**A:** In general, OU recommends vaccination, masking, and social distancing.
See the [OU Together website](https://www.ou.edu/together) for details.

OSG’s understanding is that, as sponsored guests of an Oklahoma state institution, vaccines for attendees cannot be required.

For the curious, [the Oklahoma Governor’s Executive Order](https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/executive/2004.pdf)
may provide further information.
