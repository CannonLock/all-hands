# OSG All-Hands Meeting 2018 &ndash; Local Details

The [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org) (OSG) All-Hands Meeting 2018 will be held March 19&ndash;22 at
the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).

For information about hotels, please see the [hotels page](hotels.md).

## Conference Venue

The meeting will be in the [Officers Club](http://www.universityguesthouse.com/Officers-Club) (150 S Fort Douglas Blvd)
on the University of Utah campus.  Their site contains photos and maps of the location.  Room assignments will be shown
in [the Indico timetable](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/15344/timetable/) and there will be signs in the facility with
each day&rsquo;s schedule.

## Transportation

Coming soon!

## Parking

The conference hotel has its own parking lot and is a very short walk to the Officers Club, so there is no need for
separate hotel and conference parking if you stay there.

For attendees who drive to the meeting from elsewhere, we will be assigned a parking lot and you can park there for free
during the days of the meeting.  Details on which parking lot to use will be posted closer to the event.
