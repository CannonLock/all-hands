# OSG AHM 2022 &ndash; Registration


## Registration for Online Attendance

To register for the virtual All-Hands Meeting,
[follow this link](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/53029/registrations/) to the Indico registration system.

Registration is free,
but is required for security reasons.
If you hope to attend any of the online event, please register now;
it takes only a couple minutes.

## In-Person Attendance - Cancelled

To register,
[follow this link](https://oupacsrcc-web.ungerboeck.net/reg/reg_p1_form.aspx?oc=10&ct=PART&eventid=10048)
to the University of Oklahoma registration system.
You must create an account there to complete registration.

Registration for the in-person OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 costs **$70**, which includes:

* Attendance Monday through Wednesday (Thursday and Friday are virtual only)
* Hot beverage service all day, and morning and afternoon snacks

If OSG cancels the in-person component, you will receive a full refund of your registration fee.

Once you register for in-person attendance, you are done!
Please do not register separately for the online component, because that is included here.

**Note:** The registration deadline for in-person attendance is **February 17**.
If at least 30 people register for the in-person parts by that date,
and if enough staff are available,
we plan to proceed with the hybrid event;
otherwise, we will cancel the in-person parts and have just the online parts.
