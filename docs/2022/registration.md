# OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 &ndash; Registration

## Registration for the In-Person Parts

### Costs for in-person attendance

Registration for the in-person OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 costs **$70**, which includes:

* Attendance Monday through Wednesday (Thursday and Friday are virtual only)
* morning snacks, afteroon snacks, and beverages throughout

Registration for the virtual OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 has no charge.


### Registering for in-person attendance

There are separate registration forms for the in-person and virtual only sessions. Please register only once for either the in-person or the virtual.  If you register for in-person you do NOT need to also register for the virtual sessions. 

The registration systems for the in-person and virtual will be linked from here very soon.

When registering for the in person sessions, please indicate which days you plan to attend so that we have
accurate counts for catering and so forth.
