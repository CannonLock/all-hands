# OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 &ndash; Registration

## Registration for the In-Person Parts

### Costs for in-person attendance

Registration for the in-person OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 costs **$70**, which includes:

* Attendance Monday through Wednesday (Thursday and Friday are virtual only)
* morning snacks (light breakfast), afteroon snacks, and beverages throughout

If OSG cancels the in-person parts, you will receive a full refund of your registration fee. 

(Registration for the virtual OSG All-Hands Meeting 2022 has no charge.)

### In-person registration deadline

The deadline for registration for the in-person parts is February 17. If at least 30 people register for the in-person parts by that date, and if enough staff are available, we plan to proceed with the hybrid event; otherwise, we will have to cancel the in-person parts and have just the online parts.


### Registering for in-person attendance

There are separate registration forms: one for the in-person and one for the virtual only sessions. Please register only once for either the in-person or the virtual.  If you register for in-person you do NOT need to also register for the virtual sessions. 

The registration systems for the in-person and virtual will be linked from here very soon.

When registering for the in person sessions, please indicate which days you plan to attend so that we have
accurate counts for catering and so forth.
